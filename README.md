# From Parenthood to Pay Gaps: A Heterogeneous Study of the Child Penalty in the German Labor Market (1984-2020) and the Role of Parental Leave Policy (Elterngeld)

This repository contains the code for my Master's thesis in Economics at LMU Munich, which examines the effect of parenthood on pay gaps in the German labor market and investigates how parental leave policy (Elterngeld) influences these effects. The analysis spans data from 1984 to 2020 and utilizes heterogeneous analysis to uncover differences across various subgroups such as region, sector, education, and more.
